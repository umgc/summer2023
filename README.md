# Personal Transcription Assistant

This is the application being developed by Team B for Summary 2023 Capstone Project at University of Maryland Global Campus.

## Project Description

A number of prior projects try to help people suffering from Short-Term Memory Loss (STML) by listening to a conversation and then retrieving information from that conversation. Please view the associated videos from the link above. Some of them relied upon "trigger" phrases to start taking a note or to stop. This semester we are going to get rid of the trigger phrases, transcribe the conversation, and when asked a question about the conversation, send the transcribed conversation to ChatGPT through its API, and request it to answer the question based upon the transcribed conversation, before playing that response. I want you all to understand the nuances of ChatGPT and then pose the question in a way that best serves the needs of the user. I want you to clearly document all the different approaches you took to question ChatGPT with its responses and why was your choice the best choice among all.
